In my experience discussing and delivering IBM Watson cognitive computing services to my clients, the single most common question I almost always receive from CXOs is - How long will it take for us to train Watson to complement the job my people are doing? Well the reality is, it is a sizeable effort in any implementation that goes into training Watson with customer specific data. 

With IBM releasing prepackaged and pretrained Watson AI Tools, it definitely will reduce the training lead times. Thereby helping clients reduce the time to market for several of their Watson based initiatives. 

For instance, IBM Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture gathers data from multiple sources – such as weather, IoT enabled tractors and irrigators, satellite imagery, and more – and provides a single, overarching, predictive view of data as it relates to a farm in an easy-to-use app. Thereby helping the individual growers make informed decisions and improve the yield. If you are interested, below is the detailed announcement regarding the pretrained industry Watson packs that are becoming available.
